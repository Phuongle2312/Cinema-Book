# Project Rules

## Language & Communication Protocols
- **Communication:** ALWAYS converse with the user in **Vietnamese**.
- **Artifacts:** All artifacts (plans, docs, reports) must be written in **Vietnamese**.
- **Code/Website:** All code logic, variable names, comments, and the Website UI must remain in **English** (International standard).

## Testing Protocols
- **No Browser Testing:** Do NOT use the automated browser tool for testing or verification. Perform backend tests via CLI (`php artisan test`) and leave frontend verification for manual user review.
